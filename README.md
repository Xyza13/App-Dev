It is an adaptation of the novel SOTUS: พี่ว้ากตัวร้ายกับนายปีหนึ่ง by Bittersweet. The title SOTUS refers to the S.O.T.U.S.  system which Kongphop (Prachaya Ruangroj) and his fellow freshmen have to undergo to be recognized by the hazing team, led by third-year student Arthit (Perawat Sangpotirat), as their official junior students. As the activities unfold, the two groups go through a series of conflicts and reconciling, and the friendship and love among them gradually flourish.
